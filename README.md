## Overview

The FM Transmitter project allows you to create your own FM radio station. Using an Arduino UNO and the Si4713 breakout, you can easily transmit audio signals to nearby FM radios. This project is perfect for hobbyists and professionals alike who want to explore the world of radio frequency transmission.

## Features

- **Wide Frequency Range**: Transmit audio on FM frequencies from 87.5 to 108 MHz.
- **RDS Support**: Broadcast additional information like song titles and artist names.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple setup and easy-to-follow instructions.
- **Open Source**: All code and schematics are available for modification and improvement.

## Hardware Requirements

To get started, you will need the following hardware:

- **Arduino UNO**: The main microcontroller for the project.
- **SparkFun Si4713 Breakout**: The FM transmitter module.
- **Audio Source**: Any line-level audio source, such as a smartphone or MP3 player.
- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For connecting components.
- **Power Supply**: Ensure your Arduino has a stable power source.

## Software Requirements

You will need the following software to upload the code to your Arduino:

- **Arduino IDE**: Download it from the [official Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).
- **Si4713 Library**: Install the Si4713 library through the Arduino Library Manager.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   Open your terminal and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Visibwa/FM-Trasmitter.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: 
   Open the Arduino IDE and install the Si4713 library.

3. **Upload Code**: 
   Open the `.ino` file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Arduino UNO.

4. **Connect Hardware**: 
   Follow the schematic provided in the repository to connect your components.

5. **Power Up**: 
   Once everything is connected, power up your Arduino and audio source.

## Usage

After setting up the hardware and uploading the code, you can start broadcasting. Adjust the frequency and RDS settings as needed. For detailed instructions on usage, refer to the documentation included in the repository.
